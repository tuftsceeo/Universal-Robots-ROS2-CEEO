This line drawing demo uses the python program "linedraw" found at https://github.com/LingDong-/linedraw.

To run the demo, clone the linedraw repository, start the ROS UR Driver, start the Action Server Node, and then start the Brain_Node after you have specified your .jpg image in the Brain_Node.py file.
