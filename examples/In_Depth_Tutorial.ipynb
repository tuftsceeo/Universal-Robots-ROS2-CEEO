    "The MyUR3e class is a part of the myur library and enables advanced control of the MyUR3e arm through simple Python commands. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to using the `MyUR3e` class for controlling the UR3e robot arm. The `MyUR3e` class offers various functionalities, including basic operations like reading joint states, controlling the gripper, and of course moving the arm. To see examples of how a full robot program is built using this class, check out other files in the example folder. \n",

    "You can move the robot arm using either global cartesian coordinates or joint angles. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. Specifying global coordinates is certainly easier to use and will require less work. However, by only specifying the position of the end effector you are leaving the specific pose of the arm up to the IK solver (inverse kinematic solver). By default, the IK solver will find the pose closest to the arms current position. There are instances when this might not give you the desired pose and at that point you should specify the position using `move_joints`. Additionaly, using `move_joints` allows you to create isolated movements like panning the robot left or right or rotating the wrist.\n",

In the context of the code, this means that we don't move on from the move command until it is finished. But what if we don't want to wait around for that to happen? All of the move commands have a `wait` parameter that allows us to do just that. If we set `wait=False` we can move on to other code while the move command is executing. For example, we might want to monitor the force sensor, close the gripper, or print out values while the arm is moving to a new pose."
